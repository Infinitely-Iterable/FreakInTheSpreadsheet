- 👋 Hi, I’m @Infinitely-Iterable
- 👀 I’m interested in music, calculators, and making my life easier through my little projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly python, but am dipping my toes into SQL and PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything. I do not have a ton of free time generally, but when I do, I like to spend it figuring things out.
- 📫 The best place to reach me is at my email: grantdecap@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Prior to working in data/business consulting, I spent my time as a roadie, and chasing hurricanes/tornadoes in the off season with a disaster recovery and response NGO.
